# Apartment Price Prediction Project

## Project Overview
This project predicts apartment prices based on key features such as location, size, and other relevant attributes. It utilizes machine learning techniques to build a predictive model, providing valuable insights for real estate analytics.

## Contents of the Repository
1. **`Apartment Price Prediction.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data exploration, preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and prediction.
2. **`cluj_prices_lm.pkl`**: Dataset used for training and evaluating the machine learning model.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Project Highlights
- **Data Preparation**: Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset to handle missing values and categorical variables.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized key trends and relationships in the data.
- **Model Development**: Trained and evaluated a regression model to predict apartment prices.
